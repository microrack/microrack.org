It features compact, affordable preassembled modules that can be arranged on a breadboard. MICRORACK is easy to learn and it's designed for everyone from beginners to experienced musicians and enthusiasts."},{"question":"How much will MICRORACK cost?","answer":"We aim to keep MICRORACK affordable. Starter Kit: Under $150 (single breadboard with our best modules). Learning Kit: Around $250 (two breadboards, dozen modules, extras). Pro Rack Kit: Approximately $350 (portable Eurorack-compatible chassis with modules). Individual modules will also be available for purchase separately."},{"question":"When will MICRORACK be available?","answer":"We plan to launch our Kickstarter campaign in late July 2024. The first modules are expected to ship to first bakers this fall, shop orders will available in later in 2024."},{"question":"Will MICRORACK be available internationally?","answer":"Since MICRORACK is launching on the Kickstarter we ship everywhere where Kickstarter works."},{"question":"Can a beginner use MICRORACK?","answer":"MICRORACK is designed with beginners in mind. We will provide step-by-step tutorials and the system has an intuitive, LEGO-like concept. With MICRORACK it's easy to start creating music even if you're new to modular synthesis."},{"question":"Can MICRORACK be used with other instruments or equipment?","answer":"Yes! MICRORACK can be combined with various instruments via CV and MIDI. You can process external audio, add effects and integrate it with  any existing setup. It's great for designing not just the synths, but effects pedals, and even mixers. You can connect sensors, any signal or noise sources and get very surprising results in sound. There is no limit for creativity."},{"question":"Is MICRORACK programmed? Are modules analog?","answer":"MICRORACK is not programmed in any way. MICRORACK modules are all analog, with a few exceptions like PT-chip based digital delay and counter chip in the sequencer. But we are going to offer separate digital ESP32-based Arduino compatible module for advanced features like MIDI-CV conversion, oscilloscope, USB audio-interface, MaxMSP import and more."},{"question":"What makes MICRORACK different from other modular systems?","answer":"Accessibility and very compact design. It's a powerful analog system that's super portable, easy to learn, and compatible with bunch of gear. It's surprisingly expressive and customizable. Given it's size and hackability you can use it in new ways and environments, with new mediums and techniques."},{"question":"Is MICRORACK compatible with other modular systems?","answer":"Yes, MICRORACK is designed to be compatible with other modular systems, including Eurorack. MICRORACK modules are powered by +12V/-12V and work with +5V/-5V signal levels. We've designed simple 3x3.5mm Jack adapter module and in addition we offer a Rack Chassis add-on that allows you not just to have portable modular unit but also to integrate MICRORACK modules right into your Eurorack case and setup."},{"question":"What modules are included with MICRORACK?","answer":"MICRORACK offers a wide range of modules including VCOs, Filters, Envelope Generators, LFOs, Sequencers, and more. Our Kits come with a variety of modules to get you started. Beside that we're constantly developing new modules to expand the MICRORACK ecosystem."},{"question":"What power sources are compatible with MICRORACK?","answer":"MICRORACK power is versatile, supporting 5-14V via DC barrel jack or 5/9/12V via USB Type-C. It can be powered by a standard power supply, laptop, or even a power bank for portable use."},{"question":"How can I contribute to the MICRORACK community?","answer":"Spread the word, follow and share. Join our forum to discuss any ideas and feedback. You can also contribute by developing your own module or collaborating with us on a branded one."},{"question":"Can I create my own modules for MICRORACK?","answer":"Absolutely! We encourage DIY module creation. After our Kickstarter campaign, we'll release open-source schematics and design files. And with our DIY Kit you can prototype your own modules right on the breadboard alongside official MICRORACK modules."}],"kits":[{"title":"Synth Starter Kit","earlyPrice":"","fullPrice":"$$159","priceSubtitle":"early birds price","description":"Portable and affordable kit for starting with modular synths.
